      "Hmm, I remember that this problem is a classic example of dynamic programming because it has overlapping subproblems. The recursive approach they mentioned would work in theory but might not be efficient for larger values of n due to repeated calculations. For instance, if n is 45, the recursion could lead to a lot of redundant calls, making the solution very slow.\n",

That aligns with the dynamic programming approach. So their approach is conceptually right but might have performance issues without memoization or an iterative method.\n",

However, the solution will be highly inefficient for larger values of n due to redundant calculations without memoization or dynamic programming optimization. The base case handling is correct (returning 1 when n=0 or n=1), and the recursive formula (f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)) accurately captures all possible ways to climb the stairs.\n",
